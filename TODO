Priority:
- CORS
- split security.py into dependencies and non-dependencies
- move scopes into other file (not constants - maybe auth or security??)
- are refresh tokens needed for a cookie based auth system?

Nice to have:
- TZ information
- JWK x5c/x5t https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69179822/jwk-key-creation-with-x5c-and-x5t-parameters
- certificate
- type of keys in KeyPair schema (wait for https://github.com/mpdavis/python-jose/pull/295)

Not yet tested:
- refresh token (JWT or UUID ???)
- use scope system to authorize usage of endpoints
- import users/roles from file
- export to file
- api token generation
- cookie based auth
- custom types for username and password (with regex - on/off via config)

Not needed:
- custom base model with fastapi jsonable_encoder
- client_id / client_secret

Done:
✓ Use Pydantic BaseSetting for Config
✓ make sure username in oauth2 is email
✓ role system
✓ scope system
✓ first user admin
✓ public key JWK endpoint
✓ DB Mixin
✓ custom logger
