Priority:
- client_id / client_secret
- CORS
- 2 methods called authenticate user (crud.user and dependencies.auth)
- difference between dep and util

Nice to have:
- TZ information
- password regex
- JWK x5c/x5t https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69179822/jwk-key-creation-with-x5c-and-x5t-parameters
- certificate
- type of keys in KeyPair schema (wait for https://github.com/mpdavis/python-jose/pull/295)

Not yet tested:
- refresh token (JWT or UUID ???)
- use scope system to authorize usage of endpoints
- import users/roles from file
- export to file
- api token generation
- cookie based auth

Not needed:
- custom base model with fastapi jsonable_encoder

Done:
✓ Use Pydantic BaseSetting for Config
✓ make sure username in oauth2 is email
✓ role system
✓ scope system
✓ first user admin
✓ public key JWK endpoint
✓ DB Mixin
✓ custom logger
